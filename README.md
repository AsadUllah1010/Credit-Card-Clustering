# Credit-Card-Clustering
Credit card clustering is the task of grouping credit card holders based on their buying habits, credit limits, and many other financial factors.
# Introduction
Credit card clustering means grouping credit card holders based on their buying habits, credit limits, and many more financial factors. It is also known as credit card segmentation. Such clustering analysis helps businesses find their potential customers and many more marketing strategies. For the task of credit card clustering with Machine Learning, we need to have a dataset based on buying history of credit card holders. I found an ideal dataset for this task that contains all the necessary features that are enough to understand credit card cluster analysis.
# Features
Here is a dataset based on customer segmentation submitted by Arjun Bhasin on Kaggle. Below are all the features in the dataset:
1. CUST_ID: Unique identification number of the customer
2. BALANCE: Balance in the bank account of the customer
3. BALANCE_FREQUENCY: How frequently the balance is updated in the account of the customer (1 means frequently updated, and 0 means not frequently updated)
4. PURCHASES: The number of purchases made by the customer
5. ONEOFF_PURCHASES: Maximum amount of one-time purchase
6. INSTALLMENTS_PURCHASES: Amount of purchases on instalments
7. CASH_ADVANCE: Cash in advance paid by the customer
8. PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: The frequency of purchases (1 means high frequency, 0 means low frequency)
9. ONEOFF_PURCHASES_FREQUENCY: The frequency of one-time payment purchases (1 means high frequency, 0 means low frequency)
10. PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY: The frequency of purchases on instalments (1 means high frequency, 0 means low frequency)
11. CASH_ADVANCE_FREQUENCY: Frequency of cash in advance payments
12. CASH_ADVANCE_TRX: Number of cash in advance transactions
13. PURCHASES_TRX: Number of transactions on purchases
14. CREDIT_LIMIT: Credit limit of the customer
15. PAYMENTS: Amount of payments made by the customer
16. MINIMUM_PAYMENTS: Amount of minimum payments made by the customer
17. PRC_FULL_PAYMENT: Percentage of full payment made by the customer
18. TENURE: The tenure of the credit card service of the customer
# Conclusion
There are three features in the dataset which are very valuable for the task of credit card segmentation:
1. BALANCE: The balance left in the accounts of credit card customers.
2. PURCHASES: Amount of purchases made from the accounts of credit card customers.
3. CREDIT_LIMIT: The limit of the credit card.

I have added a new column as “CREDIT_CARD_SEGMENTS”. It contains labels about the group of credit card customers. The groups formed range from 0 to 4. Credit card cluster analysis means grouping credit card holders based on their buying habits, credit limits, and many more financial factors. Such clustering analysis helps businesses find their potential customers and many more marketing strategies.
